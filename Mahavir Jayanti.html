Mahavir Jayanti is one of the most important festivals in Jainism, celebrating the birth of Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara. In 2025, this day holds an even deeper spiritual meaning as it beautifully connects with the sacred observance of Paryushan, the festival of reflection, forgiveness, and inner purification. This year, Paryushan will be celebrated from August 21 to August 28.
