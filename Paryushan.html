<p>Paryushana is an annual holy event in Jainism and is usually celebrated in August, September or October in the Hindi calendar month of Bhadrapad's Shukla Paksha.[2] Jains increase their level of spiritual intensity often using fasting and prayer/meditation to help.[3][4] The five main vows are emphasized during this time.[citation needed] There are no set rules and followers are encouraged to practice according to their abilities and desires. The event lasts for 8 days and ends with the celebration of Samvatsari (forgiveness day).</p>
