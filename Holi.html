<p>Holi (IPA: ['hoːli:, hoːɭiː]) is a major Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love and Spring.[1][7][8][9] It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.[10][11] Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil,[12][13] as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu.[14][15] Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.[8][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]

Holi also celebrates the arrival of spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love.[16][23] It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season.[16][23] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (full moon day) falling on the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar.</p>
