<p><pre> Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, former president of India, was an inspiring leader and motivational speaker.<br> In July 2015 he collapsed while delivering a lecture and passed away on July 27.<br> However, his words remain relevant even to this day and continue to guide and motivate us.</p></pre>
Here are a few best-known poems written by him. In memory of Missile Man of India:        <br>
Famous air show of Paris in motion<br>
My thought too in flight and yearns for my nation<br>
When will planes designed in my land<br>
Pierce the sky as lightening in action<br>
And gracefully land as angels in full bloom<br>
All to the envy pf spellbound spectators<br>
Yes we can!!<br>
When we are united in action and addicted to deeds<br>
Sky can't be the limit for my nation in action<br>
